# CloudProject

We are doing the Performance Evaluation Project. The task is to select 4 different benchmarks and run them on the machine to test for speed between different machines with specific steps

Once the CloudLab profile is created environment that automatically downloads and installs docker. We will have docker install the different tests and automate the process.
